200g bitter (72%) chocolate (Swiss made, Spar)
65g soy-rice milk  (“natur”, Hofer) 
120g organic butter (Spar)
1cl Oban (Whisky)
1 small finger of fresh ginger
160g powder sugar
4 TS teff flour
4 medium sized eggs
60g ground almonds
8g backing powder

melt chocolate, milk and butter, stir until smooth
add whisky, sugar, stir until smooth
add flour, stir until smooth
add eggs, one by one, stir ...
put backing powder into almonds, mix thoroughly
add to dough, stir until smooth.

bake at 180°C for 35 minutes, check with needle.

in hindsight the ginger was a bad idea.
competes with the whisky, leaves some strange taste. 
texture and basic taste are great!
