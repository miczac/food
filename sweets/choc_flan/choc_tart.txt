200g bitter (72%) chocolate (Swiss made, Spar)
65g soy-rice milk  (“natur”, Hofer) 
120g organic butter (Spar)
1cl Oban (Whisky)
1 small finger of fresh ginger
160g powder sugar
4 TS teff flour
4 medium sized eggs
60g ground almonds
8g backing powder

in hindsight the ginger was a bad idea.
competes with the whisky, leaves some strange taste. 
texture and basic taste are great!
